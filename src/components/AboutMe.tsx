        Hello! I'm a seasoned full-stack software engineer with over <strong>seven years</strong> of experience in the software development lifecycle. My dual expertise as an engineer and product manager provides a unique perspective that blends technical prowess with strategic insight, ensuring the delivery of impactful software solutions aligned with organizational goals.

        What excites me most about engineering is the transition from mere development—coding, to engineering—architecting enduring solutions. I'm particularly passionate about discussing <em>system design</em> and its trade-offs, especially when these discussions align with <em>product priorities</em>. This ensures that our engineering endeavors are not only effective but also the most strategic allocation of our resources.
